For an example frontend application have a look [here](http://todomvc.com/examples/vue/).

Key features:
 * Store ToDo-Items in a database (use any database driver you like, e.g. SQLite)
 * A ToDo-Item consists of at least a 'title' (string, required)
 * Provide a [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)- and [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)-API-Endpoint for a ToDo-List
 * Write tests for your API-Endpoints & Models
 * GIT repository with meaningful commit messages
 
Nice to haves:
 * +1 [JSON API Spec](http://jsonapi.org/)
 * +1 Provide a meaningful API documentation
